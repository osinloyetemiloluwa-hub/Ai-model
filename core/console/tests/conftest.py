"""Test isolation for the console suite.

Root-cause fix for cross-test pollution (project review 2026-06-23, console
LDD pass): several tests deliberately purge the project's own modules from
``sys.modules`` (``del sys.modules[k]`` for ``corvin_console.*`` / ``forge.*`` /
``corvin_gateway.*``) and/or ``importlib.reload`` them so a fresh import re-reads
``CORVIN_HOME``. They never restore the table.

Other test modules bind a module object at *import* time
(``import corvin_console.routes.chat as chat_routes``) and later call methods on
that bound object, while patching via the dotted string path
(``patch("corvin_console.routes.chat.chat_runtime.get_session")``) which
re-resolves through ``sys.modules``. Once a prior test purged ``sys.modules``,
the bound object and the freshly-re-imported one diverge: the patch lands on the
fresh module, the route runs on the stale one, the mock never takes effect, and
the route 404s / reads the real ``~/.corvin``. Symptom: ~20 route tests that pass
in isolation fail in the full suite (execution-log, os-turns, workdir, ...).

Two autouse, function-scoped fixtures restore the baseline after every test so no
test can leak module-table or environment state into the next one. This isolates
the whole class without rewriting the individual tests.
