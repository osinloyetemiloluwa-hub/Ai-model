"""Shared, fail-closed compute-quota gate (ADR-0146 CON-ACS-01 / CON-JOBS-01).

The console exposes more than one compute-execution entrypoint. Round 1 fixed
`POST /compute/runs` (submit_run), but `POST /compute/acs/runs` and
`POST /compute/jobs` spawned/queued compute with NO `compute_units_per_day`
check — a free-tier user could loop the ungated route for unbounded paid compute
while the gated counter stayed at its 1/day cap (the CON-01 "second execute path
skips the shared gate" pattern, in the compute surface).

This module is the single enforcement point so the execution paths cannot drift.
Fail-closed: a missing license module degrades to the FREE_TIER cap
(`compute_units_per_day` = 1), never to unmetered compute.
