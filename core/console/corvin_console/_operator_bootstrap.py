"""Wheel-install operator-dependency bootstrap.

Background
----------
56 modules under ``corvin_console`` reach their runtime dependencies in
``operator/`` via repo-relative ``sys.path`` injection, e.g.::

    _REPO = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]
    sys.path.insert(0, str(_REPO / "operator" / "forge"))
    from forge import paths

This works in a *source-tree* checkout (the ``operator/`` directory is a
real sibling of ``core/``).  It breaks in a *wheel* install: the wheel
ships only ``corvin_console`` / ``core`` / ``ops`` into site-packages, so
``parents[2]`` resolves into site-packages where no ``operator/`` exists
and ``from forge import paths`` raises ``ModuleNotFoundError``.

Fix
---
The wheel build vendors the needed operator subtrees into
``corvin_console/_vendor/operator/<same-relative-layout>`` (see the
``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` block in the root
``pyproject.toml``).  This module locates that vendored tree relative to
its own ``__file__`` and prepends the mirrored subtree directories onto
``sys.path`` so the bare imports resolve from the vendored copy.

Source-tree no-op contract (load-bearing)
-----------------------------------------
In a source-tree checkout the ``_vendor/operator`` directory does NOT
exist, so :func:`ensure_operator_on_path` returns immediately without
touching ``sys.path``.  Behaviour is therefore byte-for-byte identical to
before this module existed — the per-module repo-relative injection keeps
working exactly as it did.

The function is idempotent: it can be called many times (it is invoked
from ``corvin_console.__init__``); each mirrored dir is inserted at most
once.
