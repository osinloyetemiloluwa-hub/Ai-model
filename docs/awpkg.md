# AWPKG — Portable Workflow Package Format

> **Plugin:** `core/awpkg/` ·
> **Status:** Phase 1 implemented (local install/remove/build, no registry)

AWPKG is the distribution format for Corvin workflow bundles. A `.awpkg` file
is a ZIP archive that bundles AWP workflow DAGs, Forge tools, SkillForge skills and
Cowork personas into one installable, removable, shareable unit — like an app package
for the Corvin runtime.

## Workflow topologies supported

A single package can contain multiple workflows mixing any of the AWP node types:

| Topology | Node type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Linear DAG | `agent` | `daily_news_briefing` — fetch → summarize → format |
| Parallel fan-out/fan-in | `agent` (parallel level-0) | `market_research_suite` — news + reddit + filings in parallel → merge |
| Delegation graph | `delegation_loop` | `code_review_bot` — orchestrator spawns security/perf/style workers |
| Mixed DAG + delegation | `agent` + `delegation_loop` | `trading_strategy_pack` — parallel fetchers → signal delegation loop → risk filter |
| Chatflow / human-in-the-loop | `route` + `code` + `ask_human` + `answer` | `it_support_ticket_agent` — triage → KB lookup → confirm before acting → ticket |

---

## AWP node types (ADR-0188)

The `dag` engine (`core/workflows/corvin_workflows/node_types.py`) dispatches on each
node's `type:` field. Nine types are registered:

| Node type | Role | LLM call? |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | Single `engine.spawn()` call (default when `type:` is omitted) | Yes |
| `fan_out` | Same agent replayed once per item of a state list — sequential, not parallel | Yes (× N) |
| `delegation_loop` | Manager/worker adaptive loop, bounded by `config.budget` | Yes |
| `deliver` | Fire-and-forget push of upstream output to a bridge outbox — never waits for a reply | No |
| `code` | Deterministic, sandboxed Python (`def main(...) -> dict`) — same bwrap isolation Forge tools use, no MCP registration | **Never** |
| `merge` | Deterministic fan-in: `concat_list` / `first_non_empty` / `dict_union` — no LLM re-summarizes branch outputs | No |
| `route` | Engine-native branching — `mode: condition` (structured `{selector, op, value}`, no `eval()`) or `mode: classify` (LLM-routed into N labeled branches) | `classify` mode only |
| `answer` | Chatflow terminal — sends a turn's output, never pauses | No |
| `ask_human` | Pauses the run for a human reply (see below), resumes with the answer injected into state | No |

Every node also accepts an optional `retry: {max_retries, retry_interval_s, error_strategy}`
block. `error_strategy: fail_branch` contains a failure to that node's downstream subgraph
(marked `skipped`, not executed) instead of aborting the whole run; the default `abort`
preserves the original all-or-nothing behavior.

### Chatflow (`orchestration.engine: chat`) and human-in-the-loop

Setting `orchestration.engine: chat` (instead of `dag`) marks a workflow as turn-based. It
runs on the exact same `DAGRunner` — no separate engine — but the validator (rule R11)
requires at least one `answer` or `ask_human` node, since a chat-engine workflow with
neither could never actually pause.

An `ask_human` node sends its `prompt` (or `prompt_from: <selector>`) to the same bridge
outbox `deliver` uses, then the run stops with `RunResult.state == "paused"` and a
`run_id`. The paused state is checkpointed to
`<corvin_home>/tenants/<tid>/workflow_runs/<run_id>.json` (mirrors the audit chain's
append-only, run-id-keyed pattern — no new storage subsystem). Continue it with:

```bash
python -m corvin_workflows resume <run_id> "<the human's reply>" --engine claude
```

or programmatically via `corvin_workflows.resume_workflow(run_id, reply, engine=...)`.
`expect: {field, type}` on the node coerces the free-text reply (`type: boolean` does
fail-closed whole-word matching against affirmative/negative word lists — an unrecognised
reply is never treated as consent). A `route(mode: condition)` decision made *before* the
pause is honored again after resume — the skip state survives the checkpoint round-trip.

**Console UI:** `WorkflowChatPanel` (`core/console/corvin_console/web-next/src/pages/
workflows.tsx`) renders a real chat window — conversation bubbles + a free-text reply
box — for `ask_human` pauses, distinct from the older binary `HitlApprovalBar` (approve/
reject, for the separate "approval" node type used by the console's own hand-rolled
executor). `POST /workflows/{wid}/runs/{rid}/resume` bridges to
`corvin_workflows.resume_workflow()`. **Known gap:** the console's `start_run` endpoint
still uses its own separate node executor (not `corvin_workflows.DAGRunner`), so today a
run only has a resumable checkpoint once that executor is extended to delegate
`engine: chat` workflows to `DAGRunner` — tracked as ADR-0188 follow-up work, not
silently glossed over. **Fail-closed until then:** `start_run` now *refuses* any workflow
whose graph contains a node type its executor does not implement (`code`, `merge`,
`route`, `answer`, `ask_human`) rather than silently running it as a generic `claude -p`
step — which would execute a deterministic `code` node via an LLM and, worse, let an LLM
"answer" an `ask_human` consent gate (a human-in-the-loop bypass). Such workflows must be
run with the `corvin-flow` CLI (the full `DAGRunner`) until M7 lands.

**Real LLM engine:** `corvin_workflows.engines_claude.ClaudeCliEngine` shells out to
headless `claude -p` (tool use disabled, JSON-only responses). Selected via
`corvin_workflows run <name> --engine claude` (default remains `--engine stub`, the
deterministic canned-response engine used by tests and CI).

Two bundled examples exercise every node type end-to-end, verified against both the stub
and the real `claude` engine:
`core/workflows/corvin_workflows/examples/it_support_ticket_agent.awp.yaml` (chatflow) and
`core/workflows/corvin_workflows/examples/expense_approval_pipeline.awp.yaml` (plain `dag`,
proves `code`/`merge`/`retry` work standalone, not only inside a chatflow).

→ Full design rationale: ADR-0188 (`Corvin-ADR/decisions/0188-awp-deterministic-nodes-branching-human-in-the-loop.md`).

## Coverage — what the package format represents (and what it deliberately does not)

The package's `components.workflows` entries are the workflow YAML **verbatim**, so a
workflow *definition* — all nine node types, `orchestration.engine: chat`, per-node
`retry`, `branch:` tags, `inputs` schema — round-trips **losslessly**: what you build is
byte-for-byte what installs. At install time every workflow YAML is now run through the
real AWP validator (`corvin_workflows.validator.validate`); a malformed graph or unknown
node type aborts the install with `InstallError` (previously this check was a silent
no-op — an invalid workflow could install clean).

What the package format **does not** carry today — by design, and stated here so it is
never mistaken for a silent data-loss bug:

| Artifact | In a package? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow definition (9 node types, chatflow, retry, branch, inputs) | **Yes, lossless** | Byte-exact YAML under `components.workflows` |
| **Paused-run checkpoint state** | **No — out of scope** | A paused run lives in `<corvin_home>/tenants/<tid>/workflow_runs/*.json`, is tenant- and run-scoped, and holds live conversation state (prompts, `chat_id`, accumulated outputs). It is deliberately **not** a package component: a package is a *portable definition*, not a *running instance*. Migrating a live paused run between hosts is a separate concern (out of scope for AWPKG). |
| **Cron schedule** (`meta.schedule`) | **No** | Schedules are host/tenant-local registrations, not part of the portable definition — a re-import registers no schedule. Set it after install. |
| Console chat transcript (`{wid}.chat.jsonl`) | **No** | Per-run history, host-local |

**Does the standard need extending to "fully represent" a workflow?** For the *definition*
— no: the container already carries every ADR-0188 construct losslessly. For *quality of
the install-time contract*, three extensions are worth doing (tracked as follow-ups, not
shipped in this release, so the format is honestly documented rather than quietly
incomplete):

1. **Embedded-code permission axis.** A `code` node ships arbitrary sandboxed Python, but
   the manifest's `permissions` block only models `{network, compute, secrets}` — it has
   no axis for "this package executes embedded code," and `inspect` does not surface code
   nodes. A future manifest key (e.g. `permissions.embedded_code: true`) + inspector
   output would make that visible before install.
2. **Declarable channel/bridge requirements.** `answer` / `ask_human` / `deliver` nodes
   need a specific bridge (Discord/Telegram/…); a package can't declare that today, so it
   installs silently on a host that lacks the channel.
3. **AWP-version pin.** The manifest does not pin/validate the `awp:` version of bundled
   workflows; the validator accepts any.

Checkpoints and schedules are intentionally **excluded**, not missing — see the table.

## Lifecycle

<img src="assets/awpkg-lifecycle.svg" alt="AWPKG lifecycle: AUTHOR → INSPECT → INSTALL → ACTIVE → REMOVED" width="100%"/>

1. **Author** — `corvin pkg init` scaffolds `awpkg.yaml`; `corvin pkg build` produces the ZIP.
2. **Inspect** — `corvin pkg inspect <file>` is read-only: validates the manifest, lists components, reports warnings. Zero extraction.
3. **Install** — eight pre-extraction checks must all pass before a single byte is extracted. On success the package lands in the scope directory and a `package.installed` audit event is written.
4. **Active** — Forge tools appear in the MCP namespace, skills are injected into future bridge turns, personas are available to the cowork resolver, workflows register with the scheduler and slash-command dispatcher.
5. **Remove** — `corvin pkg remove <id>` deletes the scope directory and writes a `package.removed` audit event.

---

## Security model

<img src="assets/awpkg-security.svg" alt="Eight pre-extraction checks — all fail-closed: manifest schema, component paths, no undeclared files, no path-traversal, tool namespace, network policy, SkillForge linter, AWP validator" width="100%"/>

All eight checks run **before** any file is extracted. A single failure aborts with
`InstallError` and leaves the filesystem untouched.

The path-gate hook (`operator/voice/hooks/path_gate.py`) extends its protected subtree to
include `<corvin_home>/**/packages/**` — no agent subprocess can write into an installed
package directory directly. Only the installer CLI (or its future MCP surface) may write there.

---

## Scopes

| Scope | Install location | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `user` (default) | `~/.corvin/packages/<id>/` | All projects and tenants of this user |
| `project` | `.corvin/packages/<id>/` | This repository only |
| `session` | `<corvin_home>/sessions/…/packages/<id>/` | This chat session only (testing) |

Session-scope packages are never promoted automatically.

## Audit chain events

Every install and remove writes into the unified hash-chained audit log
(`<corvin_home>/global/forge/audit.jsonl`):

```jsonc
// install
{ "event_type": "package.installed", "severity": "INFO",
  "details": { "id": "com.example.my-workflow", "version": "1.2.3",
               "scope": "user", "tenant_id": "_default" },
  "prev_hash": "…", "hash": "…" }

// remove
{ "event_type": "package.removed", "severity": "INFO",
  "details": { "id": "com.example.my-workflow", "scope": "user" },
  "prev_hash": "…", "hash": "…" }
```

---

## Relation to other subsystems

| Subsystem | Relation |
|---|---|
| **Workflow plugins** | AWPKG *is* the `.corvin-pkg` placeholder. Single-file workflow YAMLs can be shipped standalone OR inside an `.awpkg`. |
| **Plugin system** | `CorvinPlugin` protocol is the lifecycle contract. AWPKG is the *transport* for plugins that are not Python packages. |
| **Forge (L6)** | Tool JSON files ship inside `tools/`; Forge schema validator runs during install. |
| **SkillForge (L7)** | `SKILL.md` files ship inside `skills/`; SkillForge linter runs during install. Slot-mirror scope-gate applies. |
| **Cowork (L4)** | Persona YAMLs ship inside `personas/`; available to persona resolver after install. |
| **Path-gate (L10)** | `packages/**` added to protected subtree — no direct agent writes. |
| **Audit chain (L16)** | `package.installed` / `package.removed` added to the hash chain. |

---

## Tests

```bash
cd core/awpkg
python3 -m pytest tests/test_e2e.py -v
```

**52 tests** across six classes:

| Class | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `TestManifestParsing` | Schema validation, bad IDs, bad semver, empty components |
| `TestInspector` | Read-only introspection, undeclared-file warnings |
| `TestSecurity` | Path-traversal, absolute paths, undeclared files, bad tool names, missing manifest, not-a-zip, network mismatch, schema violation, declared-missing |
| `TestLifecycle` | Install/remove roundtrip, meta-file, component extraction, list, project-scope |
| `TestDAGSimple / TestDAGComplex / TestDelegation / TestMixed` | Fixture E2E: build → inspect → install → verify structure → remove |
| `TestAuditChain` | install/remove events, SHA-256 hash-chain integrity across multiple installs |
| `TestPathGateIntegration` | `is_protected_path` returns True for `packages/**` |

### Fixture workflows

| Fixture | Topology | Components |
|---|---|---|
| `dag_simple` | Linear DAG (3 nodes) | 1 workflow · 1 skill |
| `dag_complex` | Parallel fan-out/fan-in (5 nodes) | 1 workflow · 2 Forge tools · 1 skill · 1 persona |
| `delegation` | Delegation loop + synthesiser | 1 workflow · 1 Forge tool · 1 skill |
| `mixed` | DAG + delegation loop + linear DAG | 2 workflows · 3 Forge tools · 2 skills · 1 persona |
