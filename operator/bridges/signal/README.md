# Signal Bridge

## Overview

The Signal bridge is the most privacy-focused bridge in Corvin. Signal's
end-to-end encryption means that message content is never exposed to any server
outside the participants' devices. The bridge uses
[signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) — a JVM-based command-line
client for Signal — paired with a dedicated phone number that acts as the
bot identity.

This bridge is well suited for high-trust, low-volume deployments (security
researchers, small teams, compliance-conscious enterprises) where message
privacy is a hard requirement. For high-volume public bots, prefer Telegram
or Discord.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17 or later** — `java -version` must report `17.x` or higher.
  Install via your distro's package manager or from
  [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net).
- **signal-cli ≥ 0.13** — see installation section below.
- **A dedicated phone number** — the number used as the bot identity must
  **not** already be an active Signal account on another device. A virtual
  SIM (e.g. from a VoIP provider) or a dedicated physical SIM works best.
  Reusing a personal Signal account will unlink it from your phone.

## Installing signal-cli

1. Download the latest release archive from
   https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/releases

   ```bash
   VERSION=0.13.7   # replace with the latest release
   wget "https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/releases/download/v${VERSION}/signal-cli-${VERSION}-Linux.tar.gz"
   tar -xzf "signal-cli-${VERSION}-Linux.tar.gz"
   sudo mv "signal-cli-${VERSION}" /opt/signal-cli
   sudo ln -sf /opt/signal-cli/bin/signal-cli /usr/local/bin/signal-cli
   ```

2. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   signal-cli --version
   # Expected output: signal-cli 0.13.7
   ```

## Registering a Phone Number

Use this path when the phone number has never been registered on Signal before.

1. **Request registration** — Signal will send a verification code via SMS:

   ```bash
   signal-cli -u +49123456789 register
   ```

   Replace `+49123456789` with your E.164-formatted phone number.

2. **Confirm the verification code** received by SMS:

   ```bash
   signal-cli -u +49123456789 verify 123456
   ```

   If Signal offers a voice call instead of SMS, append `--voice` to the
   `register` command.

3. **Verify the account is functional**:

   ```bash
   signal-cli -u +49123456789 receive
   # Should return without error (no messages is fine)
   ```

---

## Linking an Existing Account (Alternative)

If you have an existing Signal account and want to add Corvin as a linked
device (without giving it a dedicated number), use the link flow instead.

1. **Start the link process**:

   ```bash
   signal-cli link -n "Corvin Bot"
   ```

   signal-cli will print a `tsdevice:/…` URI and optionally render a QR code
   in the terminal.

2. **Scan the QR code** with the Signal app on your phone:
   - Open Signal → Settings → Linked Devices → Link New Device.
   - Point the camera at the QR code printed in the terminal.

3. **Confirm** — once linked, signal-cli will confirm with a message like
   `Associated with: +49123456789`. All messages sent to that number via
   Signal will now also arrive on this device.

Note: a linked device cannot initiate contacts independently — the primary
account must be the one inviting others to a conversation first.

## Configuration

Create or edit `operator/bridges/signal/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "signal_number": "+49123456789",
  "whitelist": [
    "+49987654321",
    "+491701234567"
  ],
  "signal_cli_path": "/usr/local/bin/signal-cli"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `signal_number` | Yes | E.164-formatted number registered with signal-cli. |
| `whitelist` | Yes | Array of E.164 numbers allowed to interact with the bot. Messages from numbers not in the whitelist are silently dropped. |
| `signal_cli_path` | No | Absolute path to the `signal-cli` binary. Defaults to `signal-cli` on `PATH`. |

All other standard Corvin bridge settings (`pin`, `rate_limit_per_hour`,
`chat_profiles`, `local_announce_inbound`, etc.) are supported and hot-reload
on mtime change.

---

## Starting

The recommended way is via `bridge.sh`, which manages all bridges uniformly:

```bash
bash operator/bridges/bridge.sh up
```

To start the Signal daemon directly (useful for debugging):

```bash
node operator/bridges/signal/daemon.js
```

Logs are written to the standard Corvin journal. Pipe through `bridge.sh logs signal`
to follow them.

## Limitations

- **Rate limits are strict.** Signal aggressively rate-limits accounts that send
  many messages in a short period. Accounts that trip rate limits may be
  temporarily or permanently banned. Do not use this bridge for high-volume,
  broadcast, or spammy patterns.
- **Groups are supported** but the bot must be explicitly added by an existing
  group member. The bot cannot join a group on its own.
- **No inline media** — the bridge currently delivers text replies only; rich
  media (images, files) produced by Forge tools is not forwarded over Signal.
- **signal-cli updates** — Signal occasionally changes its protocol in ways that
  break older signal-cli versions. Keep signal-cli up to date; the bridge will
  log a `signal_cli.version_mismatch` warning when a newer version is detected.
- **Single device only** — do not run signal-cli on two machines with the same
  number simultaneously; Signal will revoke one of the sessions.
