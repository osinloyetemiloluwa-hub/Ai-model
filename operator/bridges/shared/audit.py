"""Voice bridge audit log.

Events from the bridge layer (login attempts, whitelist denials, PIN
failures, channel rate-limit hits, message-received, persona-routed,
tool-use) are appended to the **same** sha256 hash-chained file the
forge plugin writes to, so a single ``voice-audit verify`` covers both
bridge and tool-factory activity.

Audit-chain strategy
====================
The hash chain is **unified** across all bridges, all forge scopes,
all personas — one chain per host, period. We therefore resolve the
default chain location at the user-global ``corvin_home() / "global"
/ "forge" / "audit.jsonl"``, *independently* of the active workspace
scope (task / session / project / user). Splitting the chain per
scope would multiply chains by 4x and defeat the single-verify
guarantee that ``voice-audit verify`` advertises.

Default path resolution (precedence high -> low):
  1. ``VOICE_AUDIT_PATH``  — explicit env override (tests use this)
  2. ``$FORGE_ROOT/audit.jsonl``
  3. ``corvin_home() / "global" / "forge" / "audit.jsonl"``

Backed by ``forge.security_events`` when the forge plugin sits next to
voice in this repo (the normal case). When forge is missing — voice
deployed standalone without forge — the audit functions become no-ops.
That preserves the legacy behaviour: voice never crashes on a missing
optional plugin.

Public API:
    audit_event(event_type, *, channel, chat_key, user, persona, tool,
                details) -> None
        Best-effort append. Silent on failure (filesystem read-only,
        forge missing, etc).

    verify_audit() -> tuple[bool, list[dict]]
        Returns (ok, problems). ``ok`` is True when the chain holds end
        to end. ``problems`` lists tampered/broken entries with line
        numbers — same shape as forge.security_events.verify_chain.

    audit_path() -> Path
        Returns the resolved audit file path (env override or default).
