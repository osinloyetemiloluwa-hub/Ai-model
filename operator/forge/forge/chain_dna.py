"""License-Seeded Audit DNA (LSAD) — ADR-0132.

Every audit event carries a ``chain_dna`` field (16 hex chars) that
is derived from:

  DNA[0] = seed(license_jwt, instance_id)   # genesis value
  DNA[n] = HMAC(DNA[n-1], hash[n-1])        # evolves with each hash

Free-tier chains use a publicly-known HMAC key; paid-tier chains use a
key derived from the license JWT's bytes, which embed an RSA signature
that only CorvinLabs' private key can produce.

Properties:
  * Tier-distinguishable: free vs. paid DNA are cryptographically distinct.
  * Chain-bound: each event's DNA depends on all prior hashes — rewriting
    or inserting events produces a different DNA from that point on.
  * Unforgeable (paid): reproducing paid-tier DNA requires the exact JWT
    bytes, which contain an RSA signature over the customer claims.
  * Backward-compatible: events without ``chain_dna`` are skipped during
    verification (pre-LSAD legacy events).

Audit events: see EVENT_SEVERITY entries ``license.chain_dna_seeded``
and ``license.chain_dna_mismatch`` in security_events.py.
