"""License token verifier — ADR-0092 M1.

Ed25519 public-key verification, session-token loading, and the central
get_limit() / assert_limit() API that enforcement call-sites use.

The private signing key lives in 1Password (op://CorvinLabs/…).
Only the PUBLIC key is here — it can verify but never forge tokens.

Token discovery order (first non-empty wins):
  1. CORVIN_LICENSE_KEY env var       (legacy / OSS single-token)
  2. ~/.config/corvin-voice/session.key   (auto-written by refresh daemon)
  3. <corvin_home>/global/license.key
  4. tenant.corvin.yaml::spec.license_key (per-tenant override — not yet wired)

In-process trust boundary (ADR-0139)
------------------------------------
This module's enforcement state — the module-level ``_ACTIVE_LICENSE`` name,
the ``assert_limit`` / ``is_feature_allowed`` callables, and the env-var
snapshots — lives in the adapter's own Python interpreter. ADR-0138 raised the
bar against *external* attacks (PYTHONPATH injection, env-var mutation after
boot, filesystem races). It does NOT — and cannot — protect against arbitrary
*in-process* Python code, which can rebind ``_ACTIVE_LICENSE`` to a forged
dict, reach the proxied dict via ``gc.get_referents()``, or rebind the imported
``_lic_assert_limit`` alias in the adapter module. ``MappingProxyType`` (see
``_freeze_license``) blocks casual item-assignment on the proxy but is NOT a
security boundary against gc-underlay or name-rebind.

ADR-0139 accepts this as a documented limitation (Option C) with compensating
controls — the bwrap sandbox keeps Forge tool code out of this interpreter, the
L10 path-gate blocks Python-file writes to license modules, and MCP servers
(which DO load in-process) require operator vetting. The out-of-process enforcer
(Option A) is the earmarked long-term fix. Do NOT add partial ``__setattr__``
hardening (Option B) here — it only mitigates name-rebind, leaves the gc vector
open, and creates a false sense of security (ADR-0139 § "What must NOT happen").
